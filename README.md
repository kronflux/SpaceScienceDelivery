# Factorio: Space Science Delivery fork

This is a fork of [@nicolas-lang](https://github.com/nicolas-lang) / [@Karoschel](https://mods.factorio.com/user/Karoschel)'s mod [Space Science Delivery](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/nco-SpaceScienceDelivery) ([Source](https://github.com/nicolas-lang/Factorio.SpaceScienceDelivery))

This mod simplifies the space science research process by allowing science packs to be sent by the Space Science Delivery Cannon at the cost of some additional resources.

This fork removes the blacklisted items (Space Science Packs and Basic Tech Cards, for example) as I felt it was a rather silly restriction considering the mod's purpose.
