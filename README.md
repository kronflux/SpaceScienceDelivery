# Factorio: Space Science Delivery
When playing Factorio with Earendel's Space Exploration mod, I never liked the micromanagement of sending rockets with the right ammount of science packs to space.
This mod simplifies the process by allowing science packs to be sent by a SE-Selivery-Cannon at the cost of some additional resources.

Feel free to review and improve my code.
